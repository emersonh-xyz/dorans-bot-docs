# Configuring Alerts for your server

⚠️ Before you can receive alerts, make sure you've [linked an account](linking-accounts) to the bot.

### Setting a channel for match alerts

To set a channel for match alerts, type `/config alerts matches [channel]`. 

That's it! Once the channel is set, start playing some games and the bot will start sending alerts in the channel you've selected. 

### Toggling different game types

The bot allows you to configure what type of matches you'd like to receive alerts for. As of right we support a multitude of gamemodes including:
- Ranked Solo/Duo
- Ranked Flex
- Normal Draft
- ARAM
- URF

> **Hint:** By default, the bot will send alerts for all game types. You can toggle them on and off using the command below.

Type `/config alerts type [game-type]` to toggle the game type you want to receive alerts for.
