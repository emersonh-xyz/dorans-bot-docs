# Configuring Alerts for your server

⚠️ Before you can receive alerts, make sure you've [linked an account](linking-accounts) to the bot.

To set a channel for match alerts, type `/config alerts matches [channel]`. 

That's it! Once the command is executed, start playing some games and the bot will start sending alerts in the channel you've selected.
