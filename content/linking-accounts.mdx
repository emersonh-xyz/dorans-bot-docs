# Linking Summoners to your Discord account

Linking a Summoner is a prerequisite for using the bot. 

There are two ways to link your summoner: through the bot or through the Dashboard.

> **Warning:** During the linking process you have the option to verify your account. 
> This is not required, but depending on a server's settings, it may be required for alerts and other features to work properly.

### Linking via the Dashboard

Linking through the Dashboard is the easiest way to manage your connected Summoners.

1. Go to the [Dashboard](https://dorans.bot/dashboard/data-sources). or type `/account manage` in any server where the bot is present.
2. Sign-in with your Discord account 
3. Under the **Data Sources** tab, click Link new Summoner and follow the steps
And that's it! Your account is now eligible for alerts and other features of the bot.

To unlink your account, just hit the **Gear** icon next to the account you want to unlink.


### Linking through the Bot

You can link your account by using the `/account link` command in any server where the bot is present. This will start the linking process, and the bot will guide you through the steps.

> **Hint:** Ensure you provide a valid Riot Games account name and region when using the command. Valid usage example `/account link emerson xyz NA1`

To unlink a Riot Id from your account, you can use the `/account unlink` command in any server where the bot is present.


### Linking yourself to a new server
**Note: If you're only linking your account in one server you can ignore this step.**

To link your Discord account to a new server with your existing Summoners you can use `/account guild bind` to connect your Discord to the server.

You can view a full list of your connected servers from the [Dashboard](https://dorans.bot/dashboard/data-sources).
